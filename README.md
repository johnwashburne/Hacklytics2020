This web app uses a support vector machine trained on the accounts that a user follows in order to grow the user's reach and impact on Instagram. The support vector machine produces a probability representative of whether a particular Instagram account will follow back, allowing the original user to only follow users likely to return the favor. A list is built for the top 20 accounts most likely to follow back and automatically updates whenever a user follows an account on the list. Two crawlers are included: one to explore accounts in extended network, and one to follow and unfollow accounts based on their ranking in the hopes of attracting a passive stream of new followers.
