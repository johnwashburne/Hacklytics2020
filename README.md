This web app uses a support vector machine trained on the accounts that a user follows in order to grow the user's reach and impact on Instagram. The support vector machine produces a probability representative of whether a particular Instagram account will follow back, allowing the original user to only follow users likely to return the favor. A list is built for the top 20 accoounts most likely to follow back that automatically updates whenever a user follows an account on the list. Eventually, the goal is to automate the following and unfollowing process which would allow the user to passively grow their profile.
